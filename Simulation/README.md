#Objective 
The objective of the simulation portion of this project is to give a base expectation of what the real-world data from Noah should look like after being filtered. The literature reviewed will be linked below for each biological clock of interest that will be studied. For this project, basal body temperature, the sleep-wake cycle, and feeding rhythm will be studied. 

#Basal Body Temperature

[Individualized Estimation of Human Core Body Temperature Using Noninvasive Measurements](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00837.2017)

In this study, physical activity, heart rate and skin temperature are used to model basal body temperature. It also brings in the environmental variables ambient temperature and relative humidity in order to further personalized the core body temperature measurements. This study was not suited to our needs due to the fact that the data we have available is limited. However, there were several sources cited there that were helpful in creating the simulation for human core temperature. 

[Estimation of human core temperature from sequential heart rate observations](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0967-3334/34/7/781/pdf)

In this study, heart rate was used in tandem with a Kalman filter to estimate core body temperature.
