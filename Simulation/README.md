#Objective 
The objective of the simulation portion of this project is to give a base expectation of what the real-world data from Noah should look like after being filtered. The literature reviewed will be linked below for each biological clock of interest that will be studied. For this project, basal body temperature, the sleep-wake cycle, and feeding rhythm will be studied.
